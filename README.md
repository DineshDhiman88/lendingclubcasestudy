## General Information
- Lending Club Case Study will help bring out the useful information with an aim to bring out informatin which can be used to benefit organisation like Fraud Detection and Increasing the profit as well.
- To bring this information to the desk I have used Python3 and various libraries, Data in the form of Excel File.

## Conclusions
Categorical Univariate Analysis
-  Conclusion - The study was done on the purpose of the loan to know the intention of taking a loan. Single column “purpose” was taken                   for this.Results shows that maximum people take loan for debt consolidation followed by credit card payment which is                     concern as there are higher chances of people not paying the loan amount.
Segmented Univariate Analysis
- Conclusion - Borrowers Count who defaulted the loan are more in numbers in "Not Verified" category as compared to the ones who are in                  "Source Verified Category“
Derived Metrics Analysis
- Conclusion Case having Higher Revolving Credit percentage has more probability of Defaulting the Loan. As it can seen in the Charged                 off category that people who were using the revolving credit charged off.
